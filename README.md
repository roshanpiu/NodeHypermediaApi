hypermedia-tutorial
===================

Code for a Nettuts video series about hypermedia and REST API theory and practice. This example will walk through building a very basic movie API to demonstrate how to take an RPC-style ("RMM Level 0" or "Swamp of POX") API and improve incrementally, explaining concepts of resources, HTTP verbs, and hypermedia along the way.

Note: If you are starting with this tutorial, make sure you do the following after you clone the repo.

```bash
$ git fetch
$ git checkout origin/1-rpc
$ git checkout -b 1-rpc
```

This will get you onto the 1-rpc branch. As you follow along through the course, you can do the same commands to download the other branches that will allow you to keep pace with the tutorial as it builds.
